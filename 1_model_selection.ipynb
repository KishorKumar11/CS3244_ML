Precision measures how many of the “positive” predictions made by the model were correct. Recall measures how many of the positive class samples present in the dataset were correctly identified by the model. As such, f1-score elaborates on a model's classwise performance instead of its overall performance as compared to the usual accuracy metric and is used as our metric in determining h<sup>*</sup>(D)"
